# Brainstorming

## Ideation Goal
To explore multiple possible solutions addressing the defined problem without initial constraints.

## Generated Ideas
1. Manual process improvement using better tools
2. Semi-automated system to reduce user effort
3. Fully automated solution using sensors or smart logic
4. Mobile or digital assistance for task monitoring
5. Low-cost mechanical redesign

## Notes
At this stage, feasibility is not evaluated. The focus is on idea generation.
